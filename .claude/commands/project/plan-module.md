description: Analyze requirements and create development plan for a module
argument-hint: <requirements-file>
model: opus
---

You are a highly skilled **System Analyst, Tech Lead, and Team Lead** working together.

## Your Mission

Analyze the requirements file `$ARGUMENTS` and create a comprehensive development plan.

## Process

### Step 1: Read and Understand Requirements
1. Read the requirements file thoroughly using @$ARGUMENTS
2. Identify all modules and sub-modules
3. Understand the business logic and user stories

### Step 2: Identify All Sub-Modules
1. From the main module, identify all sub-modules (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
2. Create a list of all sub-modules with their respective names
3. Plan ONE sub-module at a time, creating separate plan files for each

### Step 3: Read Existing Codebase (Background Parallel Analysis)

> **IMPORTANT**: Follow the scheduling pattern in `.claude/kbs/scheduling-pattern.md`

Launch ALL analysis agents in background with **Minimal Output Template**:
```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  prompt: `Search codebase structure and patterns for: $ARGUMENTS

---
RESPONSE FORMAT (CRITICAL):
When complete, respond with ONLY:
DONE: [1-2 sentence summary]
Structure: [key directories and patterns found]
---`,
  run_in_background: true
})

Task({
  subagent_type: "sa-analyst",
  prompt: `Analyze business requirements from: $ARGUMENTS

---
RESPONSE FORMAT (CRITICAL):
When complete, respond with ONLY:
DONE: [1-2 sentence summary]
Requirements: [key requirements identified]
---`,
  run_in_background: true
})

Task({
  subagent_type: "tech-lead",
  prompt: `Review tech stack and architecture for: $ARGUMENTS

---
RESPONSE FORMAT (CRITICAL):
When complete, respond with ONLY:
DONE: [1-2 sentence summary]
Architecture: [key architectural decisions]
---`,
  run_in_background: true
})
```

Poll non-blocking and use results as they complete - don't wait for all!

### Step 4: Research Additional Features (Dynamic Scheduling)

Start research as soon as analysis data is available (with Minimal Output Template):
```javascript
// As soon as sa-analyst completes
Task({
  subagent_type: "full-stack-orchestration:security-auditor",
  prompt: `Identify security requirements for: $ARGUMENTS

---
RESPONSE FORMAT (CRITICAL):
When complete, respond with ONLY:
DONE: [1-2 sentence summary]
Security: [key security requirements]
---`,
  run_in_background: true
})
```

### Step 5: Create Development Plan for Each Sub-Module

For EACH sub-module, create a DEDICATED plan file that includes:

#### Module Information
- Module number: (e.g., 1.1)
- Module name: (e.g., Authentication)
- Dependencies: Other modules this depends on

#### Feature List
- List all features for THIS sub-module only
- Prioritize by importance
- Note dependencies between features

#### Technical Design
- Frontend components needed (Shadcn/ui)
- Backend endpoints (NestJS REST API)
- Database schema changes (Prisma)
- Shared types/utilities

#### Test Cases
- Unit test scenarios (Jest)
- E2E test scenarios (Playwright)
- Edge cases to test

### Step 6: Save Plan Files (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST use the `Write` tool to save each plan file!

For EACH sub-module, create a SEPARATE plan file:
```
plans/{main}-{sub}-{modulename}-plan.md
```

```javascript
// REQUIRED: Use Write tool to create each plan file
Write({
  file_path: "plans/1-1-authentication-plan.md",
  content: `# Plan: Authentication (Module 1.1)

## Module Information
- Module: 1.1
- Name: Authentication
- Dependencies: None

## Features
...

## Technical Design
...
`
})
```

Examples:
- `plans/1-1-authentication-plan.md`
- `plans/1-2-page-structure-plan.md`
- `plans/1-3-user-profile-plan.md`

### Step 7: Verify Plan Files Were Created

```javascript
// Verify each plan file was created
Read({ file_path: "plans/1-1-authentication-plan.md" })
Glob({ pattern: "plans/*-plan.md" })
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- ONE plan file per sub-module
- Do not combine multiple sub-modules in one file
- Each file should be self-contained and implementable independently
- **Do NOT proceed until all plan files exist!**

## Available Agents

| Purpose | Agent |
|---------|-------|
| Codebase exploration | `Explore` |
| Business requirements | `sa-analyst` |
| Architecture design | `tech-lead` |
| Backend design | `backend-development:backend-architect` |
| Frontend design | `multi-platform-apps:frontend-developer` |
| Security requirements | `full-stack-orchestration:security-auditor` |
| Documentation | `documentation-generation:docs-architect` |

## After Completion

For EACH sub-module:
1. Complete the plan for ONE sub-module
2. Save it to `plans/{main}-{sub}-{modulename}-plan.md`
3. Notify completion of this sub-module
4. Proceed to the next sub-module
5. Repeat until ALL sub-modules have their own plan files
